<h1>Spartan Mini</h1>
<h2>Expansion Board with Power</h2>

<p>This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the
<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/21333-spartan-mini" target="blank">Spartan Mini FPGA development board.</a></p>

<p>This base project includes a PCB edge defined as the same size as the
Spartan Mini PCB with the connectors placed correctly to align the two boards.
All IO present on the Spartan Mini board is connected to the project through the
0.1" expansion headers.</p>

<p>The board outline looks like the following:</p>
