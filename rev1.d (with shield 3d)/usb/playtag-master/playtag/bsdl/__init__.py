'''
This directory contains a minimal BSDL file parser that
needs to be extended in order to be very useful.

It also contains a data directory that has manufacturer's
codes and known ID codes and instruction register capture
codes for several parts.

Finally, it contains a lookup utility/module for device
identification, using the data in the database.

The tools to maintain this directory are in ../../tools/bsdl
