      Number using O6 output only:             193
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                   78
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   115 out of   1,430    8%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        80 out of   2,860    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          276
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           209 out of     276   75%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of     276    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          64 out of     276   23%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              59 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
